        <p>The first three Air Jordan sneakers, released between 1985 and 1988,
            laid the foundation for one of the most iconic lines in sneaker history.
            The Air Jordan 1, introduced in 1985, broke the mold with its bold,
            unconventional design and defiant colorways, famously banned by the NBA
            for not adhering to the uniform code, which only fueled its legend.
            The 1986 Air Jordan 2 followed, marked by its premium materials and sleek,
            minimalist aesthetic that stood in contrast to the flashy 1s, but still managed
            to make a significant impact. Then came the Air Jordan 3 in 1988, which not only
            introduced the now-legendary elephant print and visible air cushioning but also cemented
            Michael Jordan's status as a cultural icon, thanks in part to its role in his first MVP
            season and the sneaker's memorable "Jumpman" logo debut. Each release pushed
            the boundaries of basketball shoe design and solidified the Air Jordan legacy as
            a symbol of style and performance.
